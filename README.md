| Click on the "Clone or download" button to copy the project link.   |   ![Image of GitHub Clone or download button](assets/images/readme/clone-download-button.PNG)   |   
| If you are comfortable with the command line, you can copy the project link and clone it through your command line with the command `git clone`. Otherwise, I recommend choosing "**Download ZIP**".   |   ![Download ZIP option on GitHub](assets/images/readme/download-zip.PNG)  |   
|  Once the ZIP file has finished downloading, you can right click on the file to view the zip folder in your downloads.   |   ![ZIP folder in downloads](assets/images/readme/zip-folder.PNG)  |   
| Right click on the project ZIP folder that you have just downloaded and choose the option "**Copy To...**", then choose the location where you would like to save this folder.    |   ![Saving ZIP to new location with 'Copy To'](assets/images/readme/copy-to.PNG)  |   
| Navigate to the final location where you have chosen to save the project folder.   |    |   
| To view the code itself, right click, choose "open with..." and open using a text editor such as VS Code or Atom, etc.   |     |
|  Once you have cloned or downloaded the project and opened it in VS Code or another text editor, open a new terminal by navigating to Terminal -> New Terminal. A terminal will open on the page.  | ![Opening a terminal in VS Code](assets/images/readme/terminal.PNG)  |
